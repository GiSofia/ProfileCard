## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

I learned how to place two images in the same container using css grid.

```css
.container-card{
    display: grid;
    place-items: center;
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
    background-color: var(--Dark-cyan);
    background-image: url('./images/bg-pattern-top.svg'), url('./images/bg-pattern-bottom.svg');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: bottom 35.05vh right 51.85vw, top 52.1vh left 48.05vw;
    position: relative;
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning more about CSS, to know its properties very well, as well as to practice the Grid and Flexbox themes more.

### Useful resources

- [Desarrollo web](https://desarrolloweb.com/articulos/multiples-imagenes-de-fondo-con-css.html) - This website helped me to know how to place several images and give them a position.

## Acknowledgments

I did this challenge alone, without anyone's help, more than the resources I occupied.
